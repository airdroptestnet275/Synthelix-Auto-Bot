5. Display status information and points earned

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit the following constants in `index.js` to adjust behavior:

```javascript
const DELAY_BETWEEN_WALLETS = 2000; // Delay between wallet operations (ms)
const MAX_RETRIES = 3;              // Max login retry attempts
const CHECK_INTERVAL = 60 * 1000;   // Status check interval (ms)
```

## 📝 Logs

The bot provides colored console output showing:
- Wallet connection status
- Node operations (start/stop)
- Points earned
- Error messages
- Summary statistics

## 🔒 Security
